The structure should be fairly self evident, but for completeness, the columns are:

user_code = anonymised observer code. Every BirdTrack observer has a different code. For GDPR reasons these are anonymised and we have not retained the lookup back to the original observer so cannot track back.

sub_code = anonymised submission code. Every BirdTrack list submitted has a different code. Similarly anonymised for GDPR reasons. You can use this to identify all the species submitted on one list.

english_name = bird species English name

scientific_name = bird species scientific name

grid_ref = grid reference of the site centroid. This should be either a 1-km grid reference (TG1234) or a tetrad (TG12B)

latitude = latitude of the site centroid

longitude = longitude of the site centroid

uncertainty_radius = this provides a qualitative assessment of the size of grid square the site falls in - which is not strictly about the site's size, but its position in relation to grid squares. e.g. a 10 indicates that the site does not fall entirely within a 2-km square but does fall entirely within a 10-km square. The site could still be small, but just falls at square boundaries.obs_dt = date of the observation.

The data only includes positive records - i.e. there won't be zeroes for Cuckoo in January. As we don't allow lists with zero species, you should be able to use the unique list of sub_code to get the definitive list of complete lists. You can use that to infer the zeroes for Cuckoos etc as required.
