# Arrival-Modelling

This is a repository for placement work done during the summer of 2023 - using BirdTrack data to create a pipeline to estimate arrival date for a species and a year.

The code can be split into code made whilst exploring the data (no asterisk *) and code needed for the pipeline (has asterisk * in name). Only pipeline code has been fully documented.
